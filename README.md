# Multinational Data Centralisation

## Project Description

The project will assume the scenario of working in a multinational company that sells various goods across the globe. Currently, the sales data is spread across many different data sources making it not easily accessible or analysable by current members of the team. In an effort to become more data-driven, the organisation would like to make its sales data accessible from one centralised location. 

My first goal will be to produce a system that stores the current company data in a database so that it's accessed from one centralised location and acts as a single source of truth for sales data. I will then query the database to get up-to-date metrics for the business.
